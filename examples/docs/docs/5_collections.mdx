# Collections

## Understanding Collections

Collections in plre allow users to combine multiple objects, producing intricate structures.
They can unify several objects or extract overlapping regions, representing them as singular entities.
Collections respond to basic Boolean operations, allowing for union, intersection, and other combinatorial actions.

import { OperationIIcon, OperationUIcon, OperationSIcon } from '../ui/atoms'

<table>
        <tr>
                <td>
                        <OperationUIcon />
                </td>
                <td>Union</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td>
                        <OperationSIcon />
                </td>
                <td>Subtraction</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td>
                        <OperationIIcon />
                </td>
                <td>Intersection</td>
        </tr>
</table>

## The Power of Operations

Operations within collections offer a unique way to manipulate objects. By using operations like repetition or applying specific effects, users can transform a simple scene into a complex masterpiece. These are not mere aesthetic changes; they're foundational shifts in how objects exist in relation to one another.

## Fine-Tuning with Collections

While collections can handle multiple objects, it's essential to note that they don't always return a true SDF, especially during subtraction or intersection. However, users can adjust and refine these operations to achieve the desired look, ensuring the final scene looks both realistic and visually appealing.
