# Materials

## Introduction to Materials

Once an object's shape is defined, it's the material that brings it to life. Materials in plre determine how an object interacts with light, adding realism and depth to a scene. The material shaders get attached to objects post the SDF processing.

## Customizing with Materials

Users have the freedom to edit and attach materials to any object, defining how it looks under various lighting conditions. By adjusting properties such as reflectivity, transparency, and texture, objects can be made to look like everything from rough stone to polished gold.

{/* `Recommended Visualization: A slider-based image showing the same object with various material properties applied. It would show the object's appearance shifting from one material to another, such as from matte to glossy.` */}

## Contribution and Community

The open-source nature of plre encourages users to contribute.
If designs an exciting and unique material shader, it would be helpful if they could share it with.
