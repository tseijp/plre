# UI

## Introduction to plre's UI

plre provides a unique and intuitive interface designed on the foundation of Blender's UI/UX, ensuring a seamless experience for those familiar with the latter. The consistent UI is available across all major platforms, be it mobile or desktop, enabling real-time collaboration between users via WebRTC.

## Main Features of the UI

The top header of the application encompasses functionalities such as documentation access and a portal to the source code. Each view window contains a set of tools specific to that window. The buttons available will vary depending on the editor in use.

## Window Manipulation

Users have the flexibility to modify window sizes by dragging the boundaries of each view window. Furthermore, corners of these windows can be dragged to either split the window or remove unwanted ones. This adaptability ensures users can customize their workspaces to their preference.

## Window Composition

Every corner editor in plre is neatly divided into the header and main content. The header can host a variety of small structural elements like buttons, controls, widgets, and panels. For the specific purpose of each editor's main content area, one should refer to the detailed documentation under the editor section.

## Switching Between Editors

A distinct feature in the UI is the drop-down button located at the far left in each editor. By interacting with this button, users can easily switch between different types of editors without having to leave their current workspace.
